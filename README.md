## My process
- Write boilerplate css
- Set up elements in html with descriptive classes.
- Develop mobile first
- Set up the flexboxes to get the right elements grouped together in the right orientations
- Once elements are set up the media query to change the flexboxes appropriately
- Now style all the elements to make look like the design and wireframes for mobile
- Style elements for desktop

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Lots of flexbox'es
- Mobile-first workflow
- Comments for readability
- Using rem units for font-size, padding, margin and border radius.
- Using ch and % for width units
- Linear gradients
- Hover pseudo-class and cursor change
- Box-shadow css property

### What I learned

Learned to use linear gradients and the hsla color.
Learned about the box-shadow css property

### Continued development

- Continue using appropriate units for css properties.
- Continue using mobile first workflow but also ensuring that the desktop site is easily converted to just after setting the elements orientation and flexboxes.
- Always continue using comments for readability.
